/*
A professor wants to see if two students have cheated when writing a paper. Design a function : 
hasCheated(String s1,String s2, int N) 
that evaluates to true if two strings have a common substring of length N. 
Additional question after implementation. 
Assume you don't have the possibility of using String.contains() and String.substring(). 
How would you implement this?
